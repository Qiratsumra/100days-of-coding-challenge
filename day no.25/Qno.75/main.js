Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.*/
var x = 4;
//Addition:
console.log("Addition:");
console.log(x += 15);
//subtraction:
console.log("Subtraction:");
console.log(x -= 2);
//multiplication:
console.log("Multiplication:");
console.log(x *= 10);
//Division:
console.log("Division:");
console.log(x /= 2);
